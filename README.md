# Husky

A place to store translation modules to convert custom wire formats to Honeycomb formatted data structures.

IMPORTANT NOTE: most consumers of husky will probably want to use a backwards-compatible version
of the opentelemetry protobufs. If this applies to you, add the following to your go.mod file:

```go.mod
replace go.opentelemetry.io/proto/otlp => github.com/honeycombio/opentelemetry-proto-go/otlp v0.19.0
```

- [OTLP](./otlp/README.md)


## Data Transformations

List of transformations that Husky performs while translating from OTLP to Honeycomb event format. All of these transformation happen before handling the resource, scope and attributes. They will be overwritten by any attributes with matching keys. The order of precedence is (with 1 being highest):

1. Item (span, span even, span link, log record) attributes
2. Instrumentation scope attributes
3. Resource attributes
4. These transformations.
